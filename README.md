## Introduction

This repository serves as a playground for exploring and learning about different data structures in C. Whether you are a beginner looking to understand the basics or an experienced developer seeking a quick reference, you'll find a variety of implementations here.

## Data Structures

Currently, the following data structures are included:
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- ... (add more as your project evolves)

Each data structure is implemented in C and comes with detailed comments explaining the logic and usage.
